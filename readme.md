End result will have: 
1) React client for "consumers"
2) Django API to store information about user clicks from the client (and maybe some extra information)
3) Angular client for the "organization" to view information from Django API. Will also have some basic CRUD I need to plan out
4) NestJS API for crud operations
5) Python text parsing to get stored in Django API
